        <title>Bloglines for the iPhone and Mobile Phones -  Reminder</title>
	<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://worldofbloglines.wordpress.com/files/2007/12/ib_1_sm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ib_1_sm.jpg&quot; height=&quot;154&quot; width=&quot;206&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I met a big name blogger who is also a dedicated user of Bloglines.  
I couldn't help but notice his iPhone typing skills.  He was clearly pounding out 
at 40 words per minute which is super-fast on the iPhone.  I was really excited to 
hear his impressions on iBloglines, our iPhone optimized version of Bloglines.  
Unfortunately, he hadn't heard of iBloglines.  I was crestfallen.  I realized I needed 
to do a better job telling Blogliners about our great products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No better time than the present to remind everyone of the great Bloglines mobile 
products. We have 2 major product sets: iBloglines for iPhones and Bloglines for 
mobile phones.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;iBloglines for iPhones - located at &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;i.bloglines.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.bloglines.com/c/images/iui/pin_small_on.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pin - Save the story for when you get back to your Mac or PC.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.bloglines.com/c/images/iui/email.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Email Articles - Sharing is fun.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.bloglines.com/c/images/iui/spotlight.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Search - Find the latest buzz with our blog and feed search.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/spinner.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Auto Refresh of &quot;My Library&quot; - No need to hit refresh to get the latest updates.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.bloglines.com/c/images/iui/download_image.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Hide Images - We know EDGE is slow, and your time is valuable.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.bloglines.com/c/images/iui/pref_on.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Preferences - Personalizing is essential. Our Blogliners love to personalize their experience so they can optimize their feed reading flow.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bloglines for Mobile - located at &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;m.bloglines.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.beta.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;m.beta.bloglines.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why two different versions of Bloglines for mobile phones?  One is Bloglines Classic 
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://m.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;m.bloglines.com&lt;/a&gt;) which has been around for years.  
The other is our new beta product (&lt;a href=&quot;http://m.beta.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;m.beta.bloglines.com&lt;/a&gt;) 
which has the latest set of enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/beta-mobile-ft.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloglines has had a leading mobile feed reader for the last couple of years. It's always been one of our key product strengths. So we were really excited to make our mobile product even better. We were busy over the summer re-writing the mobile code from the ground up. A new version of mobile is available as part of the Bloglines Beta Releases. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.beta.bloglines.com/&quot;&gt;m.beta.bloglines.com&lt;/a&gt; on your cell phone. When we feel it's ready, we'll make it available on Bloglines Classic. Key Features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Start Page - Your Bloglines Start Page is displayed at the top of the screen. This way you can pull your favorite feeds to the top.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Pin (formerly known as Keep New) - Sometimes you want to save that special post to read later when you're not on the go.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pagination - Instead of loading all of your posts, we parse out the posts into smaller bundles to fit into the memory constraints of cell phone browser. This has numerous benefits including improved speed, better reliability and safer &quot;mark read&quot; behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evening, the Bloglines Plumber and Team will be implementing network upgrades in our data center.   The scheduled maintenance is expected to occur on 11/27 from 8:00 PM PST to 10:00 PM PST.  During this time, Bloglines will not be available.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spammer Impersonates The Bloglines Team</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
Over the weekend, a few individuals, including some of us who work on Bloglines, reported receiving Spam from Bloglines. It was a surprise for us and the few other Blogliners who also received the emails.  While the total number of emails sent appear to be small less than 1,000, we think it’s serious enough to address because the spammer impersonated official Bloglines correspondence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Event&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Emails were sent recommending several posts on a Chinese Blog via the “send a post to a friend” feature on Bloglines. The email ended with a signature from “The Bloglines Team.” The emails were not sent by anyone associated with the Bloglines Team.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Actions Taken&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We monitored our logs and suspended the spammer’s IP address restricting their usage of Bloglines. In addition, on Monday 11/19/07, we briefly shut down the “send email” feature on Bloglines to further monitor the situation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FYI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bloglines sends out email to our subscribers for purposes specific to operating Bloglines (registration verification, change password, change of terms of service and other policies, significant product announcements, etc) Most product announcements can be found on the Bloglines News Feed. We take your privacy carefully and will protect our customers from spam.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Take Care.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bloglines Volunteers Wanted!</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Blogliners, we&amp;#8217;re looking to meet you face-to-face for some quality time to discuss how you use a feed reader. We&amp;#8217;re looking to meet people who are new to feeds and feed readers. We&amp;#8217;ve met a lot of people over the past few months at conferences, the forums on the web, etc. And we love meeting our power users, but now we need to find some users who are new feeds and feed readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some key questions to determine if your right for our customer research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New to feeds and Bloglines in the past year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider yourself a non-techie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willing to do some &amp;#8220;homework&amp;#8221; about 10 minutes a day for a few days.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Have broadband.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live in the Bay Area - a must.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willing to meet with our researcher for 90 minutes during the week of 11/29 to 12/7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modest compensation will be provided for you time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we know that Bloglines attracts a wide set of people, we want to get a good mix - all ages, home or work users. So we&amp;#8217;ve created a short (5 minute) survey to help us find the folks who best represent the Bloglines audience. In turn, we&amp;#8217;ll contact you to arrange a meeting with our researcher.  If you&amp;#8217;re interested, please check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zoomerang.com/survey.zgi?p=WEB2274H2HX7HY&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Eric Engleman and the Bloglines Team&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bloglines Top 1000 - “Pitchfork: Today” Blasts Another 790k Ranks</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We were anxiously awaiting the second week of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/topfeeds&quot;&gt;Bloglines Top 1000&lt;/a&gt;.  We had no idea what was in store.  To our surprise, we saw what we thought was a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/pitchfork.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; width=&quot;121&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/b/preview?siteid=13957548&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Pitchfork: Today&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; skyrocketed 790,000 ranks.  That&amp;#8217;s right 790,000 ranks to land at 448. We double-checked the numbers and they are correct. Remember, we have millions of feeds in our database, so it is possible to jump thousands of ranks in one week. However, we will consider new ways to report this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/sewmomasew.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sew Mama Sew&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/b/preview?siteid=4645357&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Sew, Mama, Sew&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; continued to move its way up 352 rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/pioneer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Confessions of a Pioneer Woman&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; width=&quot;89&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/b/preview?siteid=12957278&quot;Confessions of a Pioneer Woman who debuted last week moved up another 303 ranks to land at Rank: 697.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/it.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IT&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/b/preview?siteid=29064&quot;&gt;@IT&lt;/a&gt; broke into the top 1000 last week with a big push from our Japanese Blogliners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/searchengine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Search Engine Journal&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/b/preview?siteid=2730859&quot;&gt;Search Engine Journal&lt;/a&gt; rose with a combination of news and helpful how-to articles like, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.searchenginejournal.com/10-places-to-find-free-images-online-and-make-your-content-more-linkable/5979/&quot;&gt;10 Places to Fine Free Images Online and Make Your Content More Linkable.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

        <title>Bloglines Experiences Downtime - Team Monitoring Situation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
As many of you might have noticed, yesterday afternoon, the Plumber returned– Bloglines experienced some downtime. The team has been looking into the situation and has attributed the root cause to multiple machine hardware failure due to human error.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As people who not only work on Bloglines, but use Bloglines, you can be assured that we’re monitoring the situation closely and will put improvements in place to prevent downtime in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bloglines Beta - Even Faster!</title>
	<description>

&lt;p&gt;
Earlier this week, we released another round of improvements
for Bloglines Beta:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It's Faster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Most people have commented on how fast the Bloglines Beta is, much
    faster than the classic site. However, a web site can never be too fast! 
    Will, Bjorn and Ben have been reviewing the front-end code looking for 
    ways to shave time off common actions. Hold onto your seats, you'll
    definitely feel the speed improvements especially in QuickView
    and 3-Pane View. We hope you relish the time saved not
    waiting to download. We are. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Back-button Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Because sometimes in life, you do need to go backwards to go
    forwards. Now you can use the browser's back button like on
    standard web sites. Hitting the back button will take you to the
    previously loaded screen. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Expandable Start Page Modules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    Some feeds just demand more space on your start page. Now you can
    change the size of the start page modules with a simple
    drag-and-expand of the lower right-hand corner of the module. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Better Support for Smaller Screens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We've noticed a number of Blogliners complaining that they were
    not able to see the &quot;Mark All Read&quot; and &quot;Edit&quot;

    buttons in the feed header. We've modified the header to better
    support smaller screen sizes and those who use a narrower browser
    window. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
- Eric Engleman &amp;amp; The Bloglines Team

        <title>Sew,Mama,Sew! on the Move</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;em&gt;Warning: This post might cause strong reactions. Please do not operate heavy machinery while reading.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://sewmamasew.com/blog2&quot;&gt;Sew, Mama, Sew!&lt;/a&gt; debuts this week in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/topfeeds&quot;&gt;Bloglines Top 1000&lt;/a&gt;, 
  climbing 790 spots from last week to claim the title of Biggest Mover. It leapt over top feeds like 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/b/preview?siteid=3126992&quot;&gt;USATODAY.com Travel - Top Stories&lt;/a&gt; 
  and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/b/preview?siteid=310529&quot;&gt;Drudge Report&lt;/a&gt;.
  Other feeds on the move include &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/b/preview?siteid=11836041&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen's blog.pmarca.com&lt;/a&gt;, 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.designspongeonline.com/&quot;&gt;Design*Sponge&lt;/a&gt;, 
  and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/&quot;&gt;MIT's Technology Review Feed&lt;/a&gt;.
  Coming in at 1000 and debuting for the first time is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepioneerwoman.com/&quot;&gt;1000 Confessions of a Pioneer Woman&lt;/a&gt;. 
  It's a great example of a independent voice that has attracted a strong community.  Pioneer Woman has great stories and sweet photos (we love the 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepioneerwoman.com/2007/11/im_a_sinner_a_dirty_rotten_sinner.html&quot;&gt;cinnamon rolls&lt;/a&gt;.)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why the Bloglines Top 1000?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  People ask us all the time about what Blogliners read.  We've had the Bloglines Top 200 for the last couple of years, 
  but  wanted to highlight even more independent voices.  We felt this was important because many have been lamenting the 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://scobleizer.com/2007/10/01/techmeme-list-heralds-death-of-blogging/&quot;&gt;demise of blogging&lt;/a&gt;.   
  As you can see, there are a number of great blogs and even more on the way.
  Blogliners subscribe to tech feeds like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slashdot.org&quot;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizmodo.com&quot;&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt; and 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boingboing.net/&quot;&gt;Boing-Boing&lt;/a&gt;, however, Blogliners also subscribe to non-tech feeds like 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tapestrycomics.com/&quot;&gt;Comics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/wordoftheday/&quot;&gt;Dictionary.com's Word of the Day&lt;/a&gt;, 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/&quot;&gt;Yarn Harlot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp&quot;&gt;New Urban Legends&lt;/a&gt; and 
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cuteoverload.com/&quot;&gt;Cute Overload&lt;/a&gt; (a staff favorite).  
  The Bloglines Top 1000 covers a wide spectrum of sites. Be sure to spend some time perusing the list; it's a great way to see what your fellow Blogliners are reading.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do you calculate the Bloglines Top 1000?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We don't want to go into too much detail, but at the core, we're tracking the number of “active” subscribers who interact with a feed during a specific time period.
  We're assuming some individuals will attempt to game the system, so we're going to keep the actual method somewhat quiet for now.  
  Be sure to note though, we are tracking indivdiual feed urls so some sites may have multiple listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do feeds in the default packages rise to the top?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  Default feeds or &quot;Quick Picks&quot; receive additional promotion which do cause them rise to the top.  
  Many of the our current packs are a bit old and we're in the process of updating the packs as part of our redesign, based on feedback from Blogliners.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Does the Bloglines Top 1000 illustrate any larger trends?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Yes, we think so. Feeds are being generated by a wide-variety of sites 
  and are being consumed by an ever broader set of people; 
  they're not just for blogs or just for the technically inclined.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Does this herald the end of blogging?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what &lt;a href=&quot;http://scobleizer.com/2007/10/01/techmeme-list-heralds-death-of-blogging/&quot;&gt;some may say&lt;/a&gt;, no. People crave social connection; blogging will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/30/techmeme-leaderboard-to-launch-attacking-technoratis-last-stronghold/&quot;&gt;Is Bloglines attacking Technorati’s final stronghold?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not at all. Bloglines has had a listing of top feeds for several years, though it used to only be the top 200. We're updating the rankings and our methodology as part of our redesign.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Today's Trifecta! - OpenID Support, Mobile and New Personalization Preferences</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a fast and furious last few weeks as the Bloglines Team has 
released four releases in four weeks. 
We've released &quot;Pin&quot;, &quot;Email Post&quot;, inline styles, and now as of today support 
for OpenID. New Personalization Preferences and Bloglines Beta Mobile. We went 
back and forth about how we should get the word out. Should we post over 
several days, make one massive post, or break it up into different posts,
We decided to launch at once and blog at once; we have detailed posts for each 
of these releases, in case you want to read more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/preview?siteid=11967&amp;itemid=145&quot;&gt;OpenID&lt;/a&gt; - Bloglines Beta and Bloglines Classic will both support OpenID. 
Going forward we'll support consuming OpenID, OpenID 2.0 and are investigating 
the use of other Open Standards such as oAuth and APML.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/preview?siteid=11967&amp;itemid=146&quot;&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt; - Bloglines Beta now has a new version of Bloglines Mobile with 
additional features such as the &quot;Start Page&quot;, &quot;Pin&quot; and improved browser 
support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/preview?siteid=11967&amp;itemid=147&quot;&gt;New Personalization Preferences&lt;/a&gt; - Bloglines Beta has added several 
new personalization features as well as implementing support for the 
current feed reading personalization features.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to keep the pace up and continue releasing features left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OpenID is now Open for Blogliners</title>
	<description>&lt;p&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/openid-large.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is our first release devoted to supporting OpenID for Bloglines 
Classic and Bloglines Beta. In the near future, Bloglines will also 
support consuming OpenIDs and OpenID 2.0 which was just released this week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now our more technical users will know right way what's going on and will be 
excited. In that case, you can go to 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://id.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;id.bloglines.com&lt;/a&gt; and get started. 
Note - OpenID is just the beginning of us working with true open standards. 
Other formats getting our attention include 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://oauth.net/&quot;&gt;oAuth (Open Authentication)&lt;/a&gt; and 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apml.org/&quot;&gt;APML (Attention Profiling Mark-up Language)&lt;/a&gt;. 
For the rest of you, let me outline a little bit about OpenID and what it will 
offer you in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenID allows you to create an identity online and use that identity to 
login to any OpenID supported site. In other words, you will no 
longer need to create a new username and password for every single website. 
How many times have you gone to a site and forgotten your login. You might 
ask yourself, was the username &quot;joe578&quot; or &quot;joejoe&quot; or &quot;bigjoe&quot; or &quot;joeanne?&quot;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can imagine that if your favorite sites allowed you to login with a 
single ID you would be able combine services and create some pretty cool 
mashups. You would be able to pick and choose the sites you like to use and the 
features you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OpenID is getting some momentum from major sites who have offered 
OpenIDs, it is still very early. So in the meantime, you will still 
need multiple IDs. But keep looking for the &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/openid-small.gif&quot;/&gt;
 OpenID symbol. You will see 
it popping up more and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to get better informed about OpenID you can check out the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://openid.net/&quot;&gt;OpenID Foundation&lt;/a&gt; or a few of the bloggers who 
cover the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.identitywoman.net/&quot;&gt;Identity Woman&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://simonwillison.net/&quot;&gt;Simon Willison's Weblog&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daveman692.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;David Recordon's Blog&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.identity20.eu/&quot;&gt;Identity 2.0 Europe&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solution-media.de/blog/&quot;&gt;Talking Web X.0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bloglines Beta Goes Mobile</title>
	<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/beta-mobile-ft.jpg&quot;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloglines has had a leading mobile feed reader for the last couple of years. 
It's always been one of our key product strengths. So we were really excited to 
make our mobile product even better. We were busy over the summer re-writing the 
mobile code from the ground up. A new version of mobile is available as part of 
the Bloglines Beta Releases. Go to 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://m.beta.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;m.beta.bloglines.com&lt;/a&gt; on your cell phone. 
When we feel it's ready, we'll make it available on Bloglines Classic. 
Key Features
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Page - Your Bloglines Start Page is displayed at the top of the screen. 
This way you can pull your favorite feeds to the top.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pin (formerly known as Keep New) - Sometimes you want to save that special 
post to read later when you're not on the go.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pagination - Instead of loading all of your posts, we parse out the posts 
into smaller bundles to fit into the memory constraints of cell phone browser. 
This has numerous benefits including improved speed, better reliability and 
safer &quot;mark read&quot; behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Personalization Preferences</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We've been comparing our fall release cycle to a mad-dash European 
tour. If it's Tuesday, it must be Paris. It's Tuesday!
We're probably launching our latest release for Bloglines Beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's release focuses on the personalization settings to optimize your 
feed reading experience. We have a combination of something old, something new, 
something borrowed and of course, the site is blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look in the header and you'll see the word &quot;settings.&quot; Click on it. 
The personalization settings page will appear.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/beta-settings.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's New?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mark Individual Posts as Read - You can now choose between Bloglines 
Classic or Bloglines Beta mark read behavior. You can either mark individual 
posts as read or mark the entire folder as read.&amp;nbsp; The current default is 
to mark individual feeds read. We'll continue to monitor the comments around 
this setting closely. We know this is very important to our long-time Blogliners. 
In addition, I want to thank those who gave us &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloglines.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/bloglines.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php?p_sid=NLejIbMi&amp;p_accessibility=0&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX3NvcnRfYnk9JnBfZ3JpZHNvcnQ9JnBfcm93X2NudD0xOCZwX3Byb2RzPSZwX2NhdHM9JnBfcHY9JnBfY3Y9JnBfc2VhcmNoX3R5cGU9YW5zd2Vycy5zZWFyY2hfbmwmcF9wY&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; 

commented in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/forums/list.php?25&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; 
or posted on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cre8asiteforums.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=54044&amp;hl=bloglines&quot;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;. 
Note - we want to make sure the people who have stood by Bloglines continue to do so. So we're listening to you all.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember View - Many people like to have a single view across all of their 
feeds.&amp;nbsp; This way there is consistency for feed reading. However, some have 
discovered the beauty of selecting different views for different feeds. For 
example, many like to read feeds with lots posts in quick view whereas comic 
feeds look better in Full View.&amp;nbsp; To each his own. The current default is to 
have all feeds stick with one view.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Use Feed CSS - CSS Support can be turned on or off. CSS means we will 
deliver the feed in the style as defined by the publisher. 
The current default is to have CSS Support on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/beta-settings-feed.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's Old?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone and Mobile settings - Fine tune your experience to make the most when you're on the go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User settings such as creating a user name which is necessary to establish an OpenID with Bloglines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change email and password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/beta-settings-mobile.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/beta-settings-email.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Something a little Different&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sort Oldest/Sort Newest - You'll notice this no longer a global 
preference available from the settings page. Now when you click sort 
Oldest/Sort News is changes the sorting view for all feeds.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/beta-settings-sort.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We appreciate all the support you've given us over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSS Support for Feeds</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, we released support for publisher defined style-sheets. 
This means going forward Bloglines will display publisher created 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets&quot;&gt;CSS 
(cascading style-sheets)&lt;/a&gt; in the main reading views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Do Publishers use CSS?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most publishers use CSS to ensure content is designed consistently 
across browsers.  If the publisher uses CSS in their feed, you'll see the 
publishers style-sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does this mean for me?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll see the content as the publisher designed it. A good example brought 
to our attention is the use of the &quot;float&quot; tag. Many bloggers use this tag to 
wrap text around an image. In the past, we wouldn't wrap the text around the 
image. Now we do. There are lots of other examples of how the content will 
be displayed a little differently. A full list of all of the CSS style 
attributes we support is located 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/help/css-support&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part everyone, will benefit because most publishers attempt 
to make their feeds readable for feed readers.&amp;nbsp; In addition, we figure 
that the people who track a few of their friends' feeds will probably like to 
see more for their friends &quot;style&quot; in their feed reader.&amp;nbsp; However, some 
publishers might make stylistic decisions which might make it hard for people 
to scan content quickly  (small grey typeface on a black-background). 
That's why we built an option to turn this CSS Support off. If the 
publisher's design style is making it hard for you to scan and read your 
feeds, just to go Account Settings, Feed Options and turn off the CSS Support.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want our Blogliners and bloggers to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Eric Engleman and the Bloglines Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;PS: If this text is blue then your reader supports CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bloglines Beta 1.0.2 - Listening to Blogliners; Edit Feeds and Folder for Beta</title>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of weeks, we've been chatting with Blogliners in our
forums, reviewing mailed in feedback and reading your blogs.&amp;nbsp; It's been
fun to see how excited people are about Bloglines.&amp;nbsp; We aim to keep you
that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest launch offers up Inline Editing of Feeds and Folders. We pushed 
it out last night.&amp;nbsp; It looks like we were caught by 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.blognewschannel.com/archives/2007/09/12/bloglines-ships-minor-update/&quot;&gt;Nathan Weinberg&lt;/a&gt;.
Here's a quick summary.

&lt;p&gt;Inline Edit Feeds and Folders - You can change the feed or folder title
name and set individual feed/folder settings such as display updated items,
display in Bloglines notifier, display in Bloglines Mobile and of course set
your privacy settings for your feed or folder.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; See screenshot 
below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/beta-edit.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might ask, &quot;What does it mean to set my privacy settings for a feed or 
folder?&quot; If you have your settings as public, your feed library is available 
to the world. Here's an example of a part of 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/public/buzzby&quot;&gt;my feed library&lt;/a&gt; so you 
can see what I read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next set of releases will feature personalization preferences including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New preferences allowing you to select different read/unread modes (Classic or Beta)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bloglines Mobile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Clippings&quot; which will be renamed &quot;Saved.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll keep you posted as we get closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Latest Construction on Bloglines Beta 1.01. - Pin, Send Email, Help and Hotkeys</title>
	<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/images/blogposts/construction_crane.jpg&quot;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morguefile.com/archive/?display=21534&quot;&gt;cohdra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week we launched our &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.bloglines.com/&quot;&gt;beta site&lt;/a&gt; 
and it looks like many of you noticed.
The overall response was exceptionally favorable, but one topic was lost 
in the excitement: the site is still

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/construction/clusters/&quot;&gt;under construction!&lt;/a&gt;
Many people thought we were done. On the other hand, a number of our 
classic Blogliners pointed out several of their favorite features missing or 
not implemented quite right.&amp;nbsp; Both parties are right. If the beta
currently fulfills your needs, great move right in. If it doesn't
fulfill your needs right now, don't fret, we still have a large number of
features to implement and a few features to refine. Take your time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've been listening to our core users and rolled out several features
from Bloglines Classic which were frequently requested by our Blogliners.
Keep an eye out for these new icons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/c/images/icon_pin_on.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Keep as New - retitled &quot;Pin&quot; - This feature temporarily saves a post
in the reading view.&amp;nbsp; It's very useful for when you see a large post, 
but don't have enough time to read the post.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/c/images/icon_email.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Email this - One of the great things about a feed reader is sharing 
all of the great posts you discover.&amp;nbsp; Click on the email button at the 
bottom of a post and you can send those especially interesting posts to a 
friend.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've also implemented a couple of other features available in the current site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/c/images/help_icon.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Help - We've implemented a dynamic help site using Right Now Technologies.
It'll allows us to create help articles on the fly. We're also going to
experiment with pointing out to great help content created by our user
community. So if we see a great tutorial someone has written, we just might
link to you.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/c/images/hotkey_extra_large.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://static.bloglines.com/c/images/hotkey.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Hotkeys - The majority of hotkeys are working:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&quot;j&quot; - advance forward in the reading view&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&quot;k&quot; - move backwards in the reading view&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&quot;r&quot; - refresh left pane&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&quot;s&quot; - advance to the next feed&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&quot;f&quot; - advance to the next folder&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&quot;A&quot; - mark your selected feed or folder as read&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&quot;n&quot; - toggle Pin - different in Classic&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&quot;o&quot; - open article in new window - different in Classic&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've included a couple of 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/52755299@N00/sets/72157601886723305/&quot;&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; 

for your viewing pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll continue to listen to Blogliners in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/forums/&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; and across the web. 
Our next set of features we're working on will include editing feed subscription 
preferences and creation of additional beta preferences that will allow you to 
configure the beta to handle read/unread posts just like in classic Bloglines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll keep you all posted as we get closer. Again thanks for the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Eric Engleman and the Bloglines Team.&lt;/p&gt;
